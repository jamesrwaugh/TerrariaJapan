# Terraria ❤️ Japan

This is a mod to provide Terraria with a Japanese translation, and also provide support for Japanese text entry in multiplayer, among other features.

This is based on the work of [synctam](https://synctam.blogspot.com/2017/05/terraria_20.html) who provided a popular translation through a closed-source executable-modifying tool. This mod aims to provide a modern open-source alternative, that is easy to use by the means of TModLoader.
